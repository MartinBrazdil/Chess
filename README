One of my first larger projects (from 2010). Chess program (including castling, promotion and en passant moves) implemented in C++ with efficient bitboard representation (64-bit unsigned int), precomputation of move lookup tables, simple minimax bruteforce search artificial intelligence, multithreaded on CPU computing approx. 100 million moves per second on my old laptop (7 moves ahead in up to few minutes).
